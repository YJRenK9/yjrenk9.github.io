      On another day with Computus Progremi, the Artificial Intelligence popped up to see how I am doing.  I decided to hear another story from Computus.  Computus Progremi told me a story about a hidden utopian country located on Earth.  Neotopia has tons of scientific discoveries, technological advancements, and fascinating innovations.  Diverse races coexist.  Neotopia makes it easier to find 5-star housing, companies, restaurants, etc.  Neotopia is like a fantastic dream city most people would love living in.  It has sci-fi/fantasy and world-building vibes.  The lore for Neotopia can be one of the ideas for an anime about the Mysteries of Life.

        In short: I see myself as a game developer, web developer, and a creative coder when it comes to being a digital media artist.  I also have diverse interests when it comes to software.

        Hi, my name is Jordan Le.  I am a Computer Engineering major minoring in Studio Art.  Besides learning how to code, I like digital art.  I am interested in learning how to use software to create technical and artistic projects, whether it'll be computer games, mobile apps, websites, digital painting, video editing, 3D modeling, animation, or anything related to digital art.  In other words, I have a wide variety of interests that has something to do with software.

        I enjoy digital art because it gives out a lot of possibilities on what you can do with application software.  You can learn how to create creative software-related projects, which made me enjoy Digital Media Art (DMA).  DMA lets you express your right-brain software skills.  Using these skills to create digital art projects can amaze people.  Also, being passionate about software engineering and digital media art develop versatile interests.

        When I was a kid, I developed a strong interest in software engineering rather than the art itself.  I enjoyed learning how to use software to create photoshopped images, videos, websites, and code art. I became more familiar with coding than art in general.  So, I thought about either being a game developer, a web developer, or a creative coder.  DMA happens to have such opportunities.

        As a digital media artist, my artwork includes creative coding, web development, photo editing, and video editing.  I have learned how to use photoshop and illustrator to create collages.  I learned how to use Premiere Pro to edit videos and make them into a story/narration.  I also learned HTML & CSS to build a website like the one you're on right now.  That also goes for the online resume I made for a software engineering class, though I also used JavaScript for that one.  Speaking of JavaScript, I've learned about it from Khan Academy when I was in high school. Khan Academy had a computer programming course that teaches students how to learn creative coding using JavaScript.  I also learned a little HTML and CSS in high school.  When I took ART 74, I learned about p5.js, which is an online creative coding Integrated Development Environment (IDE) similar to Khan Academy's computer programming course.  I used my knowledge from Khan Academy and p5.js to create an artware project that has mouse interaction.

        Besides working on DMA projects with the use of coding, I also like to use software to edit photos, edit videos, create digital paintings, etc.  These are something I do outside of school, you know, as a hobby project.  Sometimes, I wouldn't mind using those skills to help someone on the artistic part of a project.  Imagine being able to modify images to create a good work of digital art or making memes that have the moral of the story.  Imagine creating videos to make life lessons, stories, talk about your passionate career or discuss any other intriguing topics.  Combining the skills and the subjects you're interested in makes digital art have a better purpose in life.  Aside from being interested in the left-brain and right-brain of software, I like learning about technology and what our universe is about, including learning new things.  I developed a curious personality in my youth and became intrigued by science fiction and worldbuilding, as both have some connections to the "mysteries of life."  So, that's why I incorporate these topics into my digital art projects.  Not to mention, I also acquire ideas from whatever comes to my mind.
      </p>

        When digital paintings come to mind, I think about drawing anime-like characters, backgrounds, and objects on the computer.  Krita and ibisPaint are my current choice of digital painting software.  They can also be animesque or drawing styles that have little to some anime influences.  I get inspirations from Adventure Time, Toki Doki, Dork Diaries, and probably other animesque drawing styles out there.  The one I have in mind has inspirations from an MMO RPG I played when I was a kid.  The anime art style felt cute and similar to a mind-blowing experience.  And that's when I started to dream about doing digital painting mainly as a hobby some days.  Additionally, I became interested in the fantasy genre.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        In conclusion, I'm pretty much open to anything relating to using software to create technical and artistic projects.  Doing these DMA projects are fun as you get to use software to create artistic work.  My future career as a digital media artist would either specialize in game development, web development, or creative coding.  That's where I can apply my coding skills along with my digital art skills.  I, as a software engineer and a digital artist, believe anyone can learn how to create projects using the software.  Thank you for taking the time to read, understand, and enjoy my artist statement.

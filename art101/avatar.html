    Choosing which avatar(that’s about you or another being) to code is one thing but transforming it with a data set is a whole nother level. Choosing one or the other is not a problem, but combining the two can be a challenge. I came up with a
    Linked List(a data structure) for my data set because I like computer programming. The Linked List was supposed to show how I went from point A(MIS & IT) to point B(SE & DMA). I wanted to show that I’m passionate about almost anything
    software-related. I figured that the Linked List should represent something. The data set I chose could be a snake or a train since it’s known to be horizontally long.
    <br>But, I eventually chose blue ghosts to represent my Linked List. Each blue ghost carries one node that represents my experience using software technology. Even though the colorful nodes don’t really represent software-related topics, I wanted to
    emphasize that it’s not just about the blue ghosts but also the contents they’re carrying. I chose blue ghosts as my avatar because I know what it’s like to not fit in with society and to feel left out. Plus, my favorite color is blue. You have a
    DMA classmate who’s interested in computer programming and digital art. Sometimes, the results are pretty. Other times, the results aren’t as good.

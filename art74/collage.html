<p>
  My digital collage is called Interdimensional Realm. The Interdimensional Realm is like a world between two dimensions(universes). A dimension that's not only a world that bridges two universes, but also a place where the scenery looks kind of like cosmic gas. A place of the phenomenal things, the sci-fi things, and the fantasy things. These things can be colorful and amazing. The interdimensional realm has something to do with my AR image because my photomosh is about three supreme leaders that takes place in another universe. I chose my theme to be something like an intersimensional space because first, it's an interesting and phenomenal topic. Second, it kinda has something to do with art, science fiction, and fantasy. And third, it was what I can think of. I could think of an interdimensional world like a work of digital art that uses multiple types of digital art styles. Throughout this semester, if there's ever an assignment that involves drawing on computer software, I would be happy to incorporate some drawing styles to my work.

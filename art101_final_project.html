  <h3>Title: Software Cell Frenzy</h3>

  <br>
  <p>
    As a software enthusiast, I’ve been hinting the “technical and artistic spectrum of software” theme since day 1 of ART 101 class. I wanted to make a game that’s not only inspired by Feeding Frenzy, Spore (Cell Stage), and Agar.io(most influence),
    but also
    emphasize on the analytical and artistic sides of software. I’d like to share this theme to anyone who’s interested in software-related things.

  <h3>Walkthrough</h3>

  <br>
  <p class="pLeft">
    To move left: LEFT_ARROW <br><br>
    To move right: RIGHT_ARROW <br><br>
    To move up: UP_ARROW <br><br>
    To move down: DOWN_ARROW <br><br>
    The more software cells you consume, the more you grow. <br><br>
    Left Software Brain: Requires green cells to be the most consumed (shows technical software occupations) <br><br>
    Middle Software Brain: Requires a balance of both or blue cells to be the most consumed (shows both software occupations) <br><br>
    Right Software Brain: Requires magenta cells to be the most consumed (shows artistic software occupations) <br><br>

  <h3>Takeaways & "Artist Statement" for This Final Project</h3>
  <br>

  <p class="pLeft">
    Since the cells are not resetted(yet), you’ll have to refresh the page if you can’t find anymore cells to consume. This is still in Beta mode, so not all of the things are added. For example, the progress bar that fills up the more software cells
    you consume. The master software cells that appear at the last stage before you win the game. They are not consumable, so watch out for them. They would appear in a “bi-path” right after a warning sign would appear. I plan to continue working on
    this final project once finals are done for this semester.
    <br><br>Doing the game project and the rest of the projects for this class was a pretty fun experience because my passion is about creating interesting things with code, whether it has something to do with technical software or artistic software.
    Not
    only has this class gave me more individual project experience but also gave me some experience in making simple games. As for someone who struggles with turning in projects on time, I always wanted to find a way to overcome that problem. I found
    out that making the project less complicated and more simple as possible was the solution to tackle this problem. Not to mention, just make a satisfiable “prototype” when time runs out, and then you can work on it more after the semester ends. In
    other words just show whatever you have even though it’s a WIP or not “finished”. I never intended to make anyone upset about my intentions, I just wanted people to understand. Overtime, I indirectly realized that I’m not the only one and more
    people are facing the similar situation, which could mean they are thinking about similar solutions to reduce this kind of struggle. I realized that one should do their best on all projects but they don’t have to pressure/stress themselves to
    make it “superb” quality, as a requirement. So, I figured there’s more to it than my initial solution, because in life, there has to be a balance. Turn things on time, but at the same time, do your best and put as much effort as possible with the
    limited time given to you.
    <br><br>As a software developer major, I’d like to spread this theme to anyone who’s interested in software technology because not only is it a fascinating concept to discuss but also not so many people bring it up. Not so many people are into
    both
    computer programming and digital art, or should I say both analytical and artistic sides of software.

    The whole point of creating this game is to determine whether the player is interested in the analytical side, the creative side, or both sides of software by playing a Feeding Frenzy/Agar.io inspired game. Of course, it's an example rather than
    a hardcore realistic approach. You can play the game however you feel content. The game just shows multiple pathways and how to reach them with the goals built into playing rather than a realistic task. I for one consider myself to be a Middle
    Software Brain person because I like both technical and artistic sides of software. When you beat the game, it'll show you software occupations you might be interested in. If you get the "Middle Software Brain" title, you'll get three lists of
    software occupations. Otherwise, you'll get one of the two lists(background and text colors would change as well). Whether you want to choose the left side, the middle, or the right side of the software spectrum is up to you. Whether you want to
    expand or narrow your interests in software is up to you. I want to make this game to spread the philosophies of the Left, Middle, and Right Software Brains. I'd also like to spread the possibilities in software occupations as well as giving
    people the opportunity to expand their horizon and feel enlightened of what software has to offer. Remember, the possibilities of software are endless.

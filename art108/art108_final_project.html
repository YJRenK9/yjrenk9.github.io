      <h3>Creating the Final Project</h3>
      <br>
      <p>
        We decided to continue with our video game prototype to save time. Plus, Parkour Quest has a lot of potentials. So, we had another person work as the producer and secondary artist to take care of the game’s production (managing Trello) and to create the tutorial art for the game.
      </p>
      <p>
        After implementing the first two levels, we planned to create the last two levels. We also planned to create new enemies and traps. The player will be able to sprint and crouch. The player will also have the option to choose a second character. Having the controls “UI” will be helpful as instructions on how to play the game will be present. Having the controls window pop up while the game is paused is a good idea because the player doesn’t want to die from an obstacle while reading what the keys do. In addition, players would have to press ‘W’ or the up arrow keys to open doors in order to proceed to the next level.
      </p>
      <p>
        The start screen was also planned for the final, which lets the player choose which character to play (Blue Girl or Red Girl). Not to mention, a win screen for the red player was the last implementation for the final project. Although the blue player is taller than the red player, the red player can jump higher than the blue player.

      <h3>Level 1: Forest Fields</h3>
      <br>
      <div class="gallery2">

      <p style="text-indent:0px;text-align:center;">Before and After</p>
      <br>
      <p>
        The first level ever made was Forest Fields, an area with evergreen trees. This level is supposedly the easiest level, which shouldn’t be a problem for players to complete. The only enemies to avoid are the two ghosts near the door. Touching them will make you start at the beginning. Entering the door will proceed to the next level.
      </p>
      <p>
        After the prototyping stage, I decided to increase the elevation of the platforms of level 1. It didn’t make sense to add a ladder when the player is able to jump on the first platform. So, it was either remove the ladder or keep it. I decided to keep the ladder but increase the platform’s elevation, so the ladder would have more of a purpose for the players to climb to the next platform. Tutorial keys are present to give clues about what the player should do and where the player should go. The two ghosts are still there but I plan to only have one ghost in the future to reduce the challenge. More importantly, to have a more linear progression in the game since I removed a few ghosts in the second level.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3>Level 2: Sakura (Cherry Tree) Fields</h3>
      <br>
      <div class="gallery2">
        <img src="game_studies_images/Parkour_Quest_Prototype_Playable.png" alt="unfixedWinScreen" width="360" height="225">
        <img src="game_studies_images/Parkour_Quest_Alpha_Playable.png" alt="unfixedWinScreen" width="348" height="286">
      </div>
      <p style="text-indent:0px;text-align:center;">Before and After</p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Because my artist chose pixelated music about a cherry tree, I decided to make the second level called Sakura Fields. This one should be more challenging than the first level. More platforms to jump on and more ghosts than in Forest Fields. Since the second level was the last level at the time, I felt like making it difficult, for now. So, I made six ghosts patrolling from “hills” and “valleys”.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although it was beatable, a lot of players were struggling to beat the level. So, I removed two ghosts. People were able to beat level 2 but a couple of people were still struggling with it. The least I can do is to remove one more ghost. Currently, there’s one ghost that patrols horizontally and two ghosts that patrol vertically. Level 2 shouldn’t be hard to complete.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3>Level 3: Aoi (Blue Tree) Fields</h3>
      <br>
      <div class="gallery2">
        <img src="game_studies_images/Parkour_Quest_Level3_Playable.png" alt="unfixedWinScreen" width="414" height="270">
        <img src="game_studies_images/Parkour_Quest_Third_Playable.png" alt="unfixedWinScreen" width="426" height="240">
      </div>
      <p style="text-indent:0px;text-align:center;">The lower half and upper half of Level 3</p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Unlike the first two levels, the last two levels are two times taller, which means it’ll take longer to beat the level. This is because there are more platforms and harmful obstacles. Due to that kind of nature, a checkpoint is needed somewhere in between, so players won’t feel frustrated. Unlike Sakura Fields, the third-level Aoi Fields have blue trees and blue-green grass.
      </p>
      <p>
        Aoi Fields introduces new enemies such as blue ghosts and snake ghosts. The blue ghosts can toggle their invisibility, meaning they can’t hurt you when they’re invisible. The snake ghosts are wide in length, meaning it’s harder to jump over them (might be possible with long jumping) but you can crouch under to evade them. This introduces the crouching mechanic for players to avoid enemies from above. Spikes and active spikes are introduced. Spikes are stationary traps to avoid, while active spikes are like spikes but hide in the ground for a short amount of time. Aoi Fields also introduces the sprinting mechanic, which lets the player perform long jumps to reach far distance platforms. It’s also a useful way to evade obstacles that trigger very fast.
      </p>
      <p>
        Like the first level, the third level has tutorial keys for new controls as the player plays through the level. Lastly, ghosts can pause for a few seconds before they change direction. I made the pause time to six seconds to test the player’s patience. But, since people found it too long of a wait, I decided to make the pause time two seconds. Plus, there will be harder levels in the future, which makes the enemy’s pause time longer. So, it wouldn’t be wise to increase the enemy’s pause time this early in the game.
      </p>

      <h3>Level 4: Night Forest</h3>
      <br>

      <p style="text-indent:0px;text-align:center;">The lower half and upper half of Level 4</p>
      <br>
      <h4>Background Music Used: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dm4kGvOxmjE">Pix - Melancholic Walk</a></h4>
      <br>
      <p>
        The fourth level, Night Forest, is as tall as the third level. Different music is used to fit the “nighttime” theme. Instead of seeing blue skies with clouds, the player will see purple skies with the stars and the moon. The grass, soil, and trees are darker than the previous levels. Although there are no new enemies or traps, there are new obstacles.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bridges are used for the player to walk from platform to platform without the need to jump. Some platforms may look real but are actually fake due to no collision for the player to stand on. This makes the level more challenging as the player are more likely to not suspect false platforms. Trial and error is the name of the game as players would have to guess which platforms are real. Also, players can either jump on the higher elevation platforms or perform long jumps. At the beginning of the level, players will face fading blue ghosts. Like the regular ghosts, these ghosts have their hitboxes permanent, meaning players would have to avoid getting hit by them. The rest of the obstacles are pretty much active spikes and stationary blue ghosts.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the final project, the door with the finish mark only appears on the fourth level as it marks the last level of the game. Upon opening this door, the player beats the game. The first three doors are regular doors without any decoration. The Night Forest marks the last and most difficult level of the game, at least for now.
      </p>

      <h3>Reviews</h3>
      <br>
      <p>
        Most of the ART 108 students found the game to be pretty fun, yet pretty challenging. They liked the artwork and the mechanics in the game. A few of the playtesters appreciated me for reaching out and implementing their feedback to further improve the game. As always, I try my best to be transparent with the playtesters because it builds clarity and resolves misunderstandings.
      </p>
      <p>
        A couple of playtesters still have issues with the speed and gravity. As I try to understand their shoes, I reduced the player’s gravity and increased the player’s speed by a little. I even implemented the sprinting mechanic for players to move faster. In addition, I agreed that the gravity was too much for the player during the prototyping phase. But at the same time, I can only do so much for the player’s gravity and speed. My intentional game design is to not have the speed and gravity far different from games like Minecraft and Maplestory. I don’t want the players to feel a little too floaty unless they’re either in space or underwater. If the speed and/or jump are increased, then it’ll decrease precision in jumping from platform to platform. This means players with increased speed/jump may struggle on jumping to the next platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        As someone who plays these kinds of games, that’s what I’ve experienced. And I’d like to emphasize that Parkour Quest is a <b>precision and patience</b> kind of game. It may be frustrating to complete but it’ll definitely pay off if you’re perseverant on those two emphasized words. The least I can do is to decrease the gravity and increase the speed by a tiny bit. I have not gotten much feedback or comments about level 4, which I’d like to hear in order to further improve my game.
      </p>

      <h3>Moving Onwards</h3>
      <br>
      <p>
        The game Parkour Quest is inspired by two games. “Parkour” comes from Minecraft’s <b>parkour maps</b>. “Quest” comes from Maplestory’s <b>jump quests</b>. It was a fun opportunity to be able to create this game. Taking this class gave me the chance to provide a working prototype for creating a computer game. I realized having good teammates would help move this project forward in a prompt manner. I’m glad people liked my game and were helpful to provide constructive feedback to further improve the game.
      </p>
      <p>
        As of making this blog post, Parkour Quest is almost done with its alpha stage. I feel like the minor details still need to be implemented before moving onto the beta stage. To name a couple of these minor things, idle animation and players being able to climb down ladders should be implemented at all levels. In the future, I plan to implement an HP mechanic to the game, which makes it “easier” but you get knocked back. The only time the player dies is when the health bar reaches zero, which shouldn’t happen so often. Although, being able to start from the nearest checkpoint is still gonna be around. Three more maps are planned to be added in the beta, and each map includes four levels. New obstacles will await in the future versions. To those who played Parkour Quest, gave positive feedback/comments, and/or helped me develop this game, I thank you very much.

      <h4>Description</h4>
      <br>
      <p style="text-indent:0px;">
        In this parkour game, you are jumping from block to block and climbing ladders to traverse the environment. If a player misses a block in an attempt to jump, they‚Äôll fall back to the ground and have to jump back to the platform again. You‚Äôll also have to avoid enemies you come across. If you touch an enemy, the game is over. The objective is to reach the goal door.
      </p>

      <h3>Known Issues:</h3>

      <p style="text-indent:0px;text-align:center;">"You Win!" screen position is a bit off</p>

      <p style="text-indent:0px;">
        The current issues for the game are the ladder not being fully functional as intended and the ‚ÄúYou Win!‚Äù screen isn‚Äôt displaying correctly on WebGL. Although the ladder mechanic was technically fixed, players still couldn‚Äôt climb down the ladder. The mechanic where players jump from ladder to ladder hasn‚Äôt been implemented yet. Although the ‚ÄúYou Win!‚Äù artwork displays correctly in the unity editor, WebGL shows part of it. In window mode, the artwork covers most of the screen, leaving a top-right blue border. In fullscreen mode, the artwork covers nearly the whole screen, still leaving a narrow bottom blue border. The ‚ÄúPlay Again‚Äù button is in the correct position.

      <h3>The Game as it is Now:</h3>
      <br>
      <p>
        Thinking before I implemented the second level, I wanted to start simple with Parkour Quest, and then add more things within the given time. I‚Äôm glad to have the artist on my side because having the artwork really enhances the gameplay and makes my life easier. I wanted a working game where the player doesn‚Äôt have any problems completing the first level. Not only that but also my ideas behind the game come forth. I also wanted players to test their platformer parkour skills and their patience. Like most prototypes, they can be prone to bugs and other inconvenient things. Despite the game being playable, some players found a few bugs and a few things that should be improved.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, I fixed the bugs, improved the game‚Äôs mechanics, and implemented new things. Most of the feedback from the alpha playtest is implemented in the current version of Parkour Quest. The bugs from a week ago shouldn‚Äôt be present. The only things that should be fixed are the known issues I mentioned. Not to mention, following up with the playtesters to see if the improvements are noticeable is a good way to know that the game is moving forward. Not all player feedback is effective, because sometimes, intentional game design happens as it‚Äôs the developer‚Äôs choice of how the game should flow. It‚Äôs kinda like how the artist designs the artwork. Having it improved may be necessary but having it in the way the artist doesn‚Äôt want it may not be necessary. That‚Äôs what I mean by intended game design.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moving forward, I decided to continue to work on the same game project to save time from starting a new one. Plus, I really like the idea of a 2D platformer obstacle course since it feels inspirational and rewarding to me. Having a team would help make my ideas become a reality with improvements and expansions. As for the final project for ART 108, I want to put as much content as possible, and at the same time, get it done on time. My mindset is to focus on the essential things first, and if there‚Äôs more time, then implement the desirable and optional things. Hopefully, my team and I would implement 2 more levels for the final game project. If not, then we would finish with whatever we have, so we can present somethiing that‚Äôs better than nothing.

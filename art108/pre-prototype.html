    <h3>Game Name: Parkour Quest</h3>
    <br>
    <h3>Roles: Programmer and Designer</h3>

      <h3>Creating the Prototype</h3>
      <br>
      <p>
        As my partner and I agreed to make a 2D platformer game for our digital prototype, I had the idea to make a parkour type game. You have the player that starts at the bottom of the map and the objective is to reach the finish goal, at the top of the map, by jumping from platform to platform. If you fall off the platform, then you may have to start from the beginning.

      <p>
        The purpose of this game is not only reaching the finish goal, but also, to practice the player’s parkour skills and to test the player’s patience. It’s also to make the player think carefully instead of impulsively tackling the obstacle course. With more levels, players will improve their parkour skills and explore new regions. This prototype game is inspired by Maple Story jump quests and Minecraft parkour maps.

        As the programmer, I do all the coding and implement the art assets into the game. I coded the player movement, one-way collision platforms, enemy collision, and the “You Win” scene. And as the designer, I design how the game should be played, including the mechanics and what the level should look like.

      <h3>Alpha Play Test Sessions</h3>
      <br>
      <p>
        For the first alpha play test session, the play tester loved the ghosts (enemy) and their movements. He also found the ghosts to be cute. It was very easy to understand how to play the game. The music and art were enjoyable as it gave a really calm and relaxing feeling. This play tester’s feedback is to increase the jump magnitude by a little. In other words, make the player jump a little higher. Although, the player speed is fine.

        For the second alpha play test session, this other play tester was very critical about Parkour Quest. The play tester wasn’t used to the arrow key controls, rather the WASD controls. The W key is the preferred key to jump than the spacebar. Since this play tester found more bugs in the game, one of his feedback is to either implement actual functional ladders or don’t implement them at all. Also, he thought it was a little pointless to add a ladder when the player can make the jump. Other bugs the play tester found were not being able to jump once the player exits the ladder’s collision, multi-jump beneath an adjacent platform, and the ghosts sometime freezing. The play tester’s view on the art is the platforms needed to look more like the foreground, so that the player doesn’t confuse the trees as platforms. Other than that, he found the jump distance alright and he liked the music.

      <h3>Takeaways</h3>
      <br>
      <p>
        Prior to the alpha play test, my partner and I thought of adding one more level afterward. We’re thinking of making the second level more challenging than the first because we can’t keep on making things easy all the time. Also, implementing the art for the “You Win” page and a couple more player animations. A couple more mechanics might be added in the future, for example, while dashing, the player can run faster and jump farther.

        From the feedback given to me, most play testers found the player a little weak on the speed and the jump. I can understand that because players are more used to characters with more speed and jump. Not to mention, it makes exploration more efficient. However, having the player have more speed and jump could make it challenging because too much speed and/or jump could miss landing on a platform. On the other hand, having more speed and jump could make the game easier as you can skip a couple more platforms for every jump. I will see if I can increase the speed and jump by a little bit. For the controls, I’m thinking of having WASD keys as an alternative for player movement since there are a lot of people who are more used to the controls(I’m not one of them). I’m thankful for the good feedback the play testers gave me. I will fix the remaining bugs and implement a few more things as I improve this digital game prototype.

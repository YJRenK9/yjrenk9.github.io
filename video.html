  From Nature to Urban is my title for my HypermediART project. This video supposed to show me explore a few natural environments and a few urban environments. It first shows a bubble freezing in a cold forest. Second, a snail approaches. Third, I saw a bee pollinating a flower at a grassy environment. Fourth, I went to a tall grass area to enjoy the good view of a lake and a natural water fountain. Fifth, I flew up and saw a road near by. I saw a family taking a road trip in a car. They were driving to an urban town. I decided to follow the car on the road by flying. I get to see the top veiw of the road within the forest. I finally arrived to town and stopped flying. The town was filled with people and cars. I explored the town and found out it had a friendly environment. After that, I opened my eyes to see myself sitting by a tree outside of my house. I decided to go inside, as I was finished envisioning how life started from nature to urban.

  notes:
    - To access my transcript, find the "SJSU Transcript" button.  A password prompt should pop up.  To make it hide, click on the same button.  This button pretty much opens and closes the password prompt.  Type in the password and click on the submit button.  Make sure it's the right password.  Otherwise, you'll be redirected to the home page instead of the transcript page.
    - To access my projects or the project I was involved in, find the drop down box that reads, "Select Project"(empty placeholder).  If you click on the drop-down list, you'll see 5 options, excluding the empty placeholder.  Click on one of them and they should redirect you to their respected webpage.
    - Project 1 is named Circuitry Font With Enchanted Symbols
    - Project 2 is named Hello All-Seeing Eye!
    - Project 3 is named Jordan's Test App
    - Project 4 is named Block Shooters
    - Project 5 is named Engineering 10 Robot 
    - Video is fit to scale, looking more like a square than a rectangle.  Video also have captions just in case if some people have a difficult time with my speech(should be mostly hearable).  A few background noises unfortunately.  Video is edited with Premiere Pro to trim pauses/jitters, to add captions, and to "change" the resolution.
    - Each project page and transcript page should have a link going back to the resume(home) page.  Only projects 4 & 5 are replaced with buttons that can redirect you to the Online Resume home page.  Reason is for "better" visibility. 
    - The image at the top of the Online Resume was taken in Honolulu, Hawaii on May 2017.
    - changed password to FrankButt to indicate which one is first name and which one is last name
    - All links, JavaScript code, and video works on both Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge
    - Used css file to make website design customizable

    <h4>Circuitry Font With Enchanted Symbols</h4>
    <p>
      I worked on this project for a graphic design class.  In my senior year of high school, I had to create a calligraphy font of my name.
      I came up with multiple ideas.  Since I'm interested in technology, I made a circuit-like design inside of the font.  Since the Fantasy RPG genre is entertaining,
      I added a light and dark aura as a unique border.  I also added two dragons that are encompassing the text.
      The light and dark represent bliss and unhappiness coexisting in the world, similar goes for the dragons.
      Speaking of dragons, their drawing style is inspired by Adventure Time.  I enjoyed creating an artwork that combines my two fascinating things.

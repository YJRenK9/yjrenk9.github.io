      The goal for this project is to make the robot search for the red beacon and press its button.
      The robot then has to find the green beacon, grab it, and move it outside of the arena.  Each group has about six people.
      Usually, two people worked on the software, two worked on the mechanical, and the other two worked on the electrical.
      The software part uses C code to program the robot to do certain actions.  The mechanical part consists of hardware parts used to construct the robot.
      The electrical part requires soldering, so the circuit board becomes functional.  When put together, the mechanical parts serve as the body for the robot,
      the computer programming serves as the internal brain for the robot, and the circuit board is what makes the robot brain functional.
      There is also the controller that acts as the physical brain and the battery that powers the robot.  If you think about it,
      This project consists of a team of software engineers, computer engineers, mechanical engineers, and electrical engineers.

      I worked on robot programming with Thai Quach.  Since he knows more computer programming than I do, I let him be the driver while I am the scriber.
      In other words, he did most of the coding while I did most of the analysis.
      I did my best to analyze each part of the code and understand what it means and why it works that way.
      I even helped to catch minor mistakes that my driver couldn't catch.  That way, he can fix the robot code better than before.
      Thai helped me understand the robot concepts and how it's applied to the functions and built-in variables.
      I liked how he made his functions to save lines of code.  It made the code more readable, along with making the function names relevant and camel-cased.
      My opportunity to work with Thai made me have a better understanding of how the robot code works.  Not only that, but it also saved me from a terrible struggle.
      It made me feel happy working with Thai Quach, and I'll never forget the time of
      actually being able to work with someone on a software project being applied to robotics.

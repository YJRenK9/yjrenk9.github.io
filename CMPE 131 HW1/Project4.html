      In Spring 2019, the professor assigned the class to do a Programming in C project.  I worked with a group of three people, including myself.
      I teamed up with Vivian and David.  We came up with an idea to create a Space Invaders-inspired game with "PvP" elements.
      The objective of this 2-player game is to shoot down your opponent.  You can either play as the blue block(player 1) or the red block(player 2).
      The controls are pretty simple.  For player 1, press A to move left, D to move right, and S to shoot.
      For player 2, press J to move left, L to move right, and K to shoot.  The player loses the game if the opponent destroys his/her block.
      Therefore, the last block standing wins.

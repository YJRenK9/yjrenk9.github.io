    <h1>ART 74 Project: Creative Eye of Graphics</h1>

    <p>
      What do you get when you combine "Hello World!" and an eye that sees everything, Hello All-Seeing Eye!  I made this project back in Fall 2018.
      P5.js a creative coding website.  JavaScript is used in P5js to create interactive and artistic projects.
      I decided to create a basic program with the "all-seeing eye" idea.  The idea is the all-seeing eye greets the user "Hello World!".
      When the user clicks on the screen, a variety of ellipses appear.  These represent a variety of subjects the eye knows,
      hence the name and why this eye is nearly omniscient.  The real name of this project is called Creative Eye of Graphics.

      I managed to create random generating ellipses when clicking on the mouse button.
      The round shapes will disappear if nothing is pressing on the left mouse button.  There are also randomly generated colors for the ellipses.
      Some of the ellipses follow the mouse cursor, which is pretty cool because it adds more interactivity.  It would be nice if the eye follows the cursor,
      but I figured it would be better for the eye to be placed at the center.  Doing this project reminds me of what I learned from Khan Academy.
      Khan Academy has a JavaScript tutorial to create shapes, colors, text, and lines.  Also, they teach you how to create a simple animation using creative coding.

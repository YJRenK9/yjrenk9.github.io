  <h3>Short Biography</h3>
    <p>
      Hello there, my name is Jordan Le.  I am a Computer Engineering Major with a Studio Art Minor.
      But, you can think of me as a Software Engineering student who's minoring in Digital Media Art.
      I have a goal to become a software engineer. I am willing to do what it takes to reach my goal.
      I choose this career because I believe I can create things and make life better for people.
      Before going to university, I had some prior programming and digital art experiences.  Most of that came from learning the skills outside of school.
      As I progress through SJSU, I learned Object-Oriented Programming and Data Structures.
      Java and C++ are the programming languages I studied the most as an SJSU student.
      I also learned more about HTML/CSS when taking a Digital Media Art class.
      I figured this was something I genuinely enjoy doing for my career. It became my passion.
      I realized how software applies to two things: technical and artistic.
      With that, the possibilities of using computer software can be endless.

      In Fall 2018, I made a basic app that can change the text, the color of the text, and the backdrop color.  It was for getting started into CodePath,
      since CodePath was hosting a mobile app development course.  Because this course "required" Xcode, which is only installable on Mac OS,
      I had to install a virtual machine in order to do this project.  I learned functions I haven't learned before, but are not hard to understand.
      After watching a tutorial video from CodePath, I decided to add a little more to this app.
      I applied my if-else knowledge to change the contents in the app when the user types in the right command and click the right button.
      This is the first app I ever created, and it feels good to create an app that has more functionality than a "Hello World!" app.

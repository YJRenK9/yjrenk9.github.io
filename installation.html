      In this bright(utopian) and informative video, I discuss an example of how art can be related to software.  Computer Graphics happens to be the example I was thinking about, but what kind of example, since computer graphics can be used for several entertaining purposes.  I decided to demonstrate an example of how creative coding can relate to computer graphics.  I chose to talk about creative coding because it combines art elements with computer programming.  You can express your coding skills through art.  You can create colorful shapes and play around with them.  A creative coding website like P5.js allows the user to create imaginative and interactive projects with the use of computer programming.

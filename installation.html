      Imagine a virtual art gallery featuring creative coding.  Ever wonder what it's like to see an art gallery about software?  Well, this Mozilla Hubs project named SoftwareArt Hall has examples of creative coding.  It's not only that but also mentions other artistic examples of software, not to mention, it has a sprinkle of authentic learning.  Creative coding is the main theme for my video installation project.  I wanted people to see an idea that combines computer programming and digital art in a video gallery.  I also wanted people to see why code art is a fascinating topic.  People can apply their coding knowledge to create colorful shapes and interactive objects.  Their curiosity and interest are how they genuinely learn how to use technology to create amazing things.  That's when passion develops, and it's essential for anyone who's into code art to cherish it.

    <p>
      Computus Progremi is known to be a friendly Artificial Intelligence (AI) that can solve your everyday problems.  Whether it's answering simple questions to complex questions all the way to having a mind of its own.  The AI can send food, water, and other objects in seconds.  It can duplicate itself onto multiple computer screens.  It can also display an image or video onto computer screens and itself, even when it's also talking.  The impressive list could go on, but its abilities are less powerful than a superintelligent AI.  Computus can be a good companion during those tough times.  The main point is to tell a story about an AI impressing a believer, helping that person be enlightened, and make him/her feel better.  A benevolent AI, like Computus Progremi brings enlightenment for our bright future.

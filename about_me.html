      <h3>Initially an IT Person</h3>
      <br>
      <p>
        As a kid, I have an interest in software technology.  I was into learning how to use computers and fixing computer problems.  That includes learning computer networks and setting up your PC.  I was also into helping people in need.  On the side, I liked playing video games and developed another interest in drawing with an anime-inspired art style.  So, my initial career was to be an IT person.
        <span>In my middle school years, I took a class called Digital Media.  We learned the basics of Microsoft Word, PowerPoint, PhotoShop, and iMovie.  I became interested in digital media because I like learning how to use software applications to create something.  I enjoyed using computers and their software applications.  Hence, Digital Media was one of my favorite classes before college.</span>
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3>The Rise of a Software Enthusiast</h3>
      <br>
      <p>
        I realized there are way more things you can do with software than I initially thought.  So, I felt like expanding my field of knowledge in computer software.  I found creating projects via software applications to be way more fascinating than merely learning one thing that's too technical.  Since I liked playing computer games, I learned the basics of 3D modeling and Unity.  I also watched Minecraft animated videos.  The creations behind these animations were intriguing.  It uses 3D modeling software, such as Autodesk Maya, that animates the Minecraft characters.  In other words, seeing one of the many things that software can do is pretty darn interesting.  So, 3D modeling and animation started to be part of my interest in computer software.  That includes game development, and it's one of my favorite fields of study.
        <span>Starting high school, I came across a Khan Academy course called Computer Programming.  The course taught me JavaScript, the first programming language I ever learned.  Not only that, but it's also how to create colorful shapes and interactive animations via computer programming.  I realized how this course teaches Khan Academy students creative coding.  In 10th grade, I continued to take another Digital Media class.  The course content was like the one I took in 7th grade, except we learned the basics of HTML and Adobe Animate.</span>
        <span>Outside of high school, I learned beginner-level Swift from TreeHouse.  I also learned intro to programming courses on Udacity and CodeAcademy.</span>
        <span>In 12th grade, I took Drawing & Painting and Graphic Design.  I like drawing and wanted to improve my illustrating skills.  I used this opportunity to express an Japanese-inspired drawing style.  I incorporated this art styles into my illustration projects as they inspired me.  Not to mention, I enjoy using any anime-inspired or animesque drawing styles.  I also enjoyed taking that Graphic Design class as it allowed me to spread existing anime-inspired art style through my art projects.</span>
        <span>At my high school, there was a Computer Science club.  The club taught the students basic programming but in C#.  Blender, a free 3D modeling and animation software, was also covered.  As a person who grew interested in computer programming and digital art, I became more eager to learn more about the things covered in the Computer Science club.  The club covered diverse computer software topics, even the artistic ones.  Because the club president was a computer prodigy, he inspired me to pursue computer programming and digital art.  And that is how I decided to become a Software Enthusiast.</span>
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3>A Passionate Idealist With Determination</h3>
      <br>
      <p>
        I grew up having a positive mindset.  I see myself more as an Idealist because I believe in a society with peace but no conflicts, where people can get along and reach their full potential.  I like learning new things in life, especially anything relating to computer software and technology.
        <span>I thought of high school not only teaching us general education (GE) but also preparing us for our future careers.  I agree learning the basics of general education is essential.  However, I believe schools should teach students authentic learning, which comes from curiosity and interest.  Students should master what they're genuinely into instead of being fed with subjects that may not be useful in their future careers.  They may forget what they learned over time, especially if the topic is boring.  Learning something unrelated to your interests may diverge your field of study, which is why I believe that no passionate career should be hindered.</span>
        <span>As someone who struggled to find the motivation to learn more computer programming, I believe the school system should offer a variety of classes that would help students progress through their future careers.  It should be about the passion and your strengths instead of being forced to excel in uninteresting GEs.  I also believe that grades aren't everything.  It's the skills that matter more.  Grades and unnecessary GEs shouldn't always act as red tape to stop someone from pursuing their passionate career.  Forcing a fish to climb a tree would discourage someone in their skill sets.  Working full-time like robots gives us less freedom of productivity and enjoyment.  We should realize our skills determine whether we're capable of a career.  Also, instead of generalizing what each student should learn, it is essential to learn relevant courses for specified careers.  Anyone can strive for their dream career if they put their mind to it.  For as long as I live, I will not give up on becoming a software developer.</span>

      <h3>A perspective of a Middle Software Brain</h3>
      <br>
      <p>
        After high school, I met a few people proficient in computer programming and digital art.  These people are like one in a million because not so many are adept in analytics and the arts.  They inspire me to expand my horizon, try something new, and create something marvelous.  That is why I look up to them.  Plus, I can relate as I'm into almost anything software-related.  I don't see myself as someone who's too technical nor artistic, but rather somewhere in between.  Having lots of interest in computer software makes me interested in more clubs.  Computer Science, Software Engineering, Digital Media Art, Computer Graphics, MIS, and IT are clubs that relate to software technology.
        <span>It's fascinating to explore and share a variety of fields.  Getting to know what the discipline is like, especially learning different experiences from others.  Also, it's to collaborate with different majors to create great projects.  For example, Disney Animation Studios hire computer scientists, software engineers, digital artists, animators, cinematographers, mathematicians, and physicists.  The same thing goes for Minecraft, except there are also IT people who specialize in cybersecurity.  So, there are people who are technical, artistic, and somewhere in between.  Within the software technology spectrum, some occupations are technical, some are artistic, and others consist of both.  Each role in the software field improves people's lives and innovates marvelous things with software technology.</span>
        <span>If the left brain is about logic and the right brain is about creativity, then the middle brain represents both analytical and artistic as it shares both sides of the brain.  Hence, people genuinely into computer programming and digital art are known to be the Middle Software Brain.  In other words, people who have diverse interests in software technology.  Most people are Left Software Brain because they are inherently technical, and STEM-related jobs are abundant with a huge pay.  Right Software Brain is those who have artistic and creative minds and enjoy working on digital art-related projects.  I'm the kind of guy who's amazed by creating software-related projects instead of writing documents all day.  That's why I signed up to become a software developer.  Unlike most people who jump on the popular bandwagon, I follow my passions and what's unique, no matter what life throws at me.</span>

      <h3>A Software Enthusiast's Vision</h3>
      <br>
      <p>
        My vision as a software enthusiast is to form a community where people can learn and exchange new things related to a software discipline.  I wanted to expand my horizon and learn new things.  I wanted to give people the opportunity to learn something new.  There are more things to grasp than just learning how to code.  Not just learning software but also using it to create something useful or entertaining.  Also, it's getting to know what opportunities and career paths are software-related.  There are a variety of software-related occupations, both technical and artistic.
        <span>Software Development, Computer Science, MIS, and IT are examples of technical occupations.  Digital Art, 3D Modeling, Animation, and Cinematography are examples of artistic professions.  Lastly, game Development and Web Development are examples of disciplines that can be both technical and artistic.  My goal is to be proficient in various software disciplines but, at the same time, find a specialization.  So far, one of the three things I would like to specialize in is game development, web development, or mobile app development.</span>

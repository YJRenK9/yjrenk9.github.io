  <p>
    A Bronze Bear who wields a sword to defeat his enemies and a textbook shield to defend him and his kind. He wields sword arts and knowledges about science and philosophy. His goal is to spread knowledge, self defense, and his beleifs to his kind
    and other kind races. There was once a meteor that came from the heavens and landed on midgard: the land of the mortals. Inside of that meteor was a sentient superior liquid bronze. The mortals investigated the meteor and were amazed to see it as
    a gift from the gods. They brought in the liquid metal to their town. The superior liquid bronze instinctively formed a humaniod bear. It generates a sword and a textbook-shield out of superior bronze. The liquid bronze became a solid and
    flexible metal. The bronze bear interacted with the mortals by showing its capabilities and allying with them. It has super strength, super durability, super intelligence, and super regeneration. In return, it improved its speech, social
    abilities, and other mortal skills. The bronze bear soon became known as the Knowledgeable bear warrior. Not to mention, have pronouns of he/him/it. Over time, the mortals used a portion of the bronze bear to create his people. The bronze bear
    realized its main goal: to protect his kind & allies, to defeat his enemies, and to enlighten others with knowledge & philosophy.<br><br>
    When I started on this 3D modeling project, I just downloaded whatever 3D models that were available on Poly Google. I used MeshMixer to mash up whatever 3D models I used, in that case, a bear head, a sword, and a textbook. I figured that the 3D
    models I downloaded would best fit as a character. So, I made anthropomorphic bear wielding a sword as a weapon and a textbook as a shield. I added cylinders for the body and limbs and a sphere as the tail. After blending some of the objects with
    the existing objects, I made the bear warrior have a bronze texture since I gave both the sword and the textbook a metallic texture. This gave me a beginner's experience in using two 3D Modeling softwares: MeshMixer and Sketchfab.
